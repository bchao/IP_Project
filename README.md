#Thoughts

We learned a lot about C programming and network architecture on this project. However,
we felt it was way too tedious with a lot of required boilerplate coding and code
that was not relevant to the class. For example, we spent many hours working out the 
serialization and deserialization methods to send our packets over the socket. We felt
like methods like these should have been provided. Also, the provided assignment
document was very vague, as were the answers posted on Piazza a lot of the time. This 
made it difficult to figure out what was expected of us in this project.

#Resources

We consulted TA Boyang Xu on this project on some portions. For the majority of the
project we worked by ourselves though.
